You're here because you made something wonderful!

Yet one of your viewers is frustrated because they can't find the song in your video.

Consider sharing that song info with the viewer who sent you here!  I'm sure they would appreciate it!

You could also improve your publishing process to reduce future frustration!  It's super easy!


## How?

Step 1: Add a line of text to the description of your video, like this:

````
Song: Sandstorm (Radio Edit) - Darude
````

There is no step 2.


## Why?

### Give credit to content creators

As a content creator yourself, you probably appreciate the value in improving sharing and discoverability of your work.  If your work builds off of others, it only makes sense to credit them for their contribution - regardless of whether monetary gain takes place.

### Support your followers

Good news: Your viewers enjoy your content!  You wouldn't be here if they weren't consuming it.

But they don't enjoy your content exclusively.  Who are you to stand between them and enjoying that awesome song you introduced them to?

This is an opportunity to springboard them into a whole network of similar content they might enjoy!  Your viewers will feel a more open and personal connection with you.  They will enjoy your content more and be more likely to share it.

### Gain new followers

Between related/recommended videos, mix playlists, and seach queries, new viewers will be more likely to find your content if you include additional text/tags/metadata!

## Don't be upset - be proud

Yes, this website was likely sent to you out of sass.  It can be very frustrating to enjoy content from creators who routinely put lengthy build specifications or sponsor links in the description, yet fail to spend a single line of text to credit the artist whose song they relied on to establish the tone and emotion for their video.

You made someone feel good with the combination of sights and sounds you produced!  Be proud!  But be humble and transparent, too.

None of us got here alone.
